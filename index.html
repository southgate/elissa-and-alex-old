      <p>Palm Springs is a fun place to explore. We hope that you get a little
      extra time to find an adventure or something tasty. We've collected a
      few suggestions of our favorite things to eat, see, and do.</p>

          <a class="place" href="http://www.kingshighwaydiner.com/" target="_blank">
            <img src="/photos/places/kings-highway.jpg" />
            <h4>King's Highway</h4>
          </a>
          <p>Right in front of Ace Hotel, King's Highway is a former Denny's
          converted into a bohemian roadside diner serving California standards,
          and Stumptown coffee. Great for Breakfast or Lunch, make sure you visit
          at least once while you're here. We'll be here for Sunday brunch.</p>

          <a class="place" href="http://www.cheekysps.com/" target="_blank">
            <img src="/photos/places/cheekys.jpg" />
            <h4>Cheeky's</h4>
          </a>
          <p>Home to one of the best Eggs Benedict in America, a fried chicken
          sandwich to die for, and for the bacon lovers: a house-cured bacon flight.
          You'll want a nap (preferably pool-side) afterwards. This place is popular
          and they don't take reservations so be prepared to wait.</p>

          <a class="place" href="http://www.lapperts.com/" target="_blank">
            <img src="/photos/places/lapperts.jpg" />
            <h4>Lappert's</h4>
          </a>
          <p>This Hawaiian-style ice cream shop is run by the son of the famous
          Lappert's of Kauai. is a perfect excuse to cool down on a hot desert day.
          Try an avocado ice cream, a shave ice, or our favorite: a Dole Whip.
          Seriously, you haven't lived until you've had a Dole Whip.</p>

          <h3>Adventure</h3>

          <a class="place" href="http://www.pstramway.com" target="_blank">
            <img src="/photos/places/tramway.jpg" />
            <h4>Aerial Tramway</h4>
          </a>
          <p>The worlds largest rotating tram car takes you on a 2.5 mile path
          up above 8,500 feet to Mountain Station for a stunning view of the valley
          below, and miles of hiking trails. The peak is about 30 degrees colder
          than downtown Palm Springs. Buy tickets ahead of time.</p>

          <a class="place" href="http://www.scootpalmsprings.com" target="_blank">
            <img src="/photos/places/scoot.jpg" />
            <h4>Scoot Palm Springs</h4>
          </a>
          <p>Rent a vespa-style scooter and go explore the city! Scoot Palm
          Springs works with the Ace Hotel and has a few scooters on site, so
          just head to the front desk to get set up. California residents need a
          motorcycle license, but any license will do for out-of-staters.</p>

          <a class="place" href="http://www.nps.gov/jotr" target="_blank">
            <img src="/photos/places/joshua-tree.jpg" />
            <h4>Joshua Tree National Park</h4>
          </a>
          <p>This massive national park is where the Mojave and Colorado deserts
          meet. A wild landscape that can feel like another planet, it gets its
          name from a tree that's right out of a Dr. Seuss book. A great place
          to hike, rock climb, and camp. Plan to spend a whole day here, it takes
          over an hour to drive to either entrance.</p>

          </a>
          <p>This museum hosts a good collection of contemporary and historic
          works, however the sculpture garden is particularly great. The
          desert-modern concrete building itself is worth the visit. Also don't
          miss the Architecture and Design center, a separate building made of
          glass with awesome views.</p>

            Friday's formal dinner is our fancy night, so class up the joint in
            your favorite color. Stay cool (and <em>cool</em>) in flowy, formal
            maxi dresses. It can get cool at night, so bring a sweater, shawl,
            scarf or other&nbsp;warmth-cocoon.

          <h4>Gents</h4>
          <p>
            For Friday's formal dinner, look sharp. Wear a suit and tie
            (or bowtie?) in whatever color you look best in (it doesn't have to
            be dark). A cotton or linen suit will be more comfortable than wool
            in the&nbsp;heat.

          <p>
            Saturday's ceremony is party time! Wear something festive that will
            take you comfortably from an outdoor ceremony to the dance floor. It
            gets cool when the sun goes down, so plan&nbsp;accordingly.
          </p>

          <p>
            For Saturday's ceremony, have fun and look good. Try a suit in a
            bright color or a fun patterned shirt. Look to your socks or pocket
            square for complimenting colors and patterns. Tie&nbsp;optional.
